"""Run a workflow starting at the given agent. The agent will run in a loop until a final
output is generated. The loop runs like so: 1. The agent is invoked with the given input. 2. If there is a final output (i.e. the agent produces something of type
`agent.output_type`, the loop terminates. 3. If there's a handoff, we run the loop again, with the new agent. 4. Else, we run tool calls (if any), and re-run the loop.
In two cases, the agent may raise an exception: 1. If the max_turns is exceeded, a MaxTurnsExceeded exception is raised. 2. If a guardrail tripwire is triggered, a GuardrailTripwireTriggered exception is raised."""s
